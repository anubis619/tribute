      <h2>Short info</h2>
      <p>Ian Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945 – 28 December 2015), known as Lemmy, was an English musician, singer and songwriter who founded and fronted the rock band Motörhead. His music was one of the foundations of the heavy metal genre. He was known
        for his appearance (including his friendly mutton chops), his distinctive gravelly voice and distinctive bass playing style. Alongside his music career, he also had many minor roles in film and television.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <p>Lemmy was born on Christmas Eve in the Burslem area of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. When Lemmy was three months old, his father, an ex-Royal Air Force chaplain and concert pianist (who died within six months of Kilmister's stepfather, in 2011)separated
        from his mother. His mother and grandmother moved to Newcastle-under-Lyme, then to Madeley. When Lemmy was 10, his mother married former footballer George Willis, who already had two older children from a previous marriage, Patricia and Tony,
        with whom Lemmy did not get along.
        <br><br> The family moved to a farm in Benllech on Anglesey, with Lemmy later commenting on his time there, that "funnily enough, being the only English kid among 700 Welsh ones didn't make for the happiest time, but it was interesting from an
        anthropological point of view."He attended Sir Thomas Jones' School in Amlwch, where he was nicknamed Lemmy. It was later suggested by some that the name originated from the phrase "lemmy [lend me] a quid till Friday" because of his alleged habit
        of borrowing money from people to play slot machines, although Lemmy himself claimed that he didn't know the origin of the name. He soon started to show an interest in rock and roll music, girls and horses.</p>

      <h2>Recording and performing career</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1960–1970: Early years</b><br>In Stockport, Lemmy joined local bands the Rainmakers and then the Motown Sect who played northern clubs for three years. In 1965 he joined the Rockin' Vickers who signed a deal with CBS, released three singles
          and toured Europe, reportedly being the first British band to visit the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy" target="_blank">more..</a></li>
          <li><b>1971–1975: Hawkwind</b><br> In August 1971 Lemmy joined the space rock band Hawkwind, who were based in Ladbroke Grove, London, as a bassist and vocalist. He had no previous experience as a bass guitarist, and was cajoled into joining immediately
          before a benefit gig in Notting Hill by bandmate Dik Mik to have two members who enjoyed amphetamines.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy" target="_blank">more..</a></li>
          <li><b>1975–2015: Motörhead</b><br> After Hawkwind, Lemmy formed a new band called "Bastard" with guitarist Larry Wallis (former member of the Pink Fairies, Steve Took's Shagrat and UFO) and drummer Lucas Fox. Lemmy and Took were friends, and Took
          was the stepfather to Lemmy's son Paul. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy" target="_blank">more..</a></li>

      <h2>Equipment</h2>
      <p>Lemmy positioned his microphone in an uncommonly high position, angled so that he appeared to be looking up at the sky rather than at the audience. He said that it was for "personal comfort, that's all. It's also one way of avoiding seeing the audience.
        In the days when we only had ten people and a dog, it was a way of avoiding seeing that we only had ten people and a dog."
        <br><br> Lemmy's first bass was a Hopf model that he bought soon after joining Hawkwind. For the majority of his career, he used Rickenbacker basses. In September 1996, his Rickenbacker bass was featured in the Bang Your Head exhibition at the
        Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, US. Rickenbacker have introduced a signature 4004LK "Lemmy Kilmister" bass.</p>
